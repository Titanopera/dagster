With our base tables populated, we can now turn our attention to the dbt project. The `project_dbt` directory, located alongside our Dagster code within the `src` directory, contains a relatively small but representative dbt project:

├── sources
│   └── raw_taxis.yml
└── staging
    ├── staging.yml
    ├── stg_trips.sql
    └── stg_zones.sql
```

It’s generally simpler to include your dbt project in the same repository as your Dagster code. This allows Dagster to easily parse the metadata files generated by dbt commands, enabling tighter integration between the two tools.

This project consists of four dbt models, which rely on two source definitions. There are also some lightweight tests (defined in the `staging.yml`) defined for a subset of the models.

| Table | Materialization | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `daily_metrics` | Incremental | No |
| `location_metrics` | Table | No |
| `stg_trips` | Table | No |
| `stg_zones` | Table | Yes |

While the SQL logic inside each model isn't the focus here, this compact project still showcases many of the core patterns you’ll encounter when working with dbt, such as staging layers, source declarations, materializations, and basic testing.

The next step will be turning these dbt models into Dagster assets, so they can be orchestrated, tracked, and monitored as part of your data pipeline.
