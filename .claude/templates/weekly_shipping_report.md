<!-- AI ANALYSIS PROMPT:
You are analyzing commit data from Dagster repositories to generate a detailed technical impact summary. Your goal is to identify concrete business value and technical achievements rather than generic categorizations.

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
1. **Business Impact First**: What problems were solved? What capabilities were added?
2. **Technical Depth**: Specific technologies, patterns, architectures implemented
3. **Strategic Value**: How does this work enable future development or reduce friction?
4. **Concrete Details**: Use actual commit messages, line counts, and specific changes

OUTPUT FORMAT:
### `repository-name` (X commits)
- **Major Achievements**: 2-3 specific accomplishments with business context
- **Technical Implementation**: Key technologies/patterns used, architecture changes
- **Scale**: Lines changed, files affected, complexity indicators
- **Strategic Impact**: How this enables future work or solves persistent problems

FOCUS AREAS TO IDENTIFY:
- **Infrastructure Evolution**: Deployment, monitoring, scaling, reliability improvements
- **Developer Productivity**: Tooling, automation, workflow improvements that save time
- **Code Quality Systems**: Automated checks, standards, testing frameworks that prevent issues
- **API & Framework Evolution**: Breaking changes, new capabilities, developer experience improvements
- **System Architecture**: Storage layers, abstractions, performance optimizations

AVOID:
- Generic categories like "bug fixes" without context
- Simple keyword matching
- Vague descriptions like "various improvements"
- Listing commits without explaining their significance
- Mentioning formatting changes, linting fixes, or code style updates
- Discussing yarn format, ruff format, line length changes, or similar cosmetic changes

EXAMPLE QUALITY:
❌ "Infrastructure improvements (5 commits): Various deployment and CI changes"
✅ "Render Deployment Infrastructure: Implemented comprehensive health monitoring system with PostgreSQL/SQLite support, enabling reliable production deployments with automated failover and database migration capabilities (+847 lines, 12 files). This replaces manual deployment processes and provides foundation for multi-environment scaling."
